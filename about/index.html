  Hello, my name is Rick Winfrey. I work at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> on the Blackbird team focused on lexical and semantic code search.
  To do this at GitHub scale on the order of 100+ million repositories is a very interesting and complex distributed systems problem! You can read more about our technology and approach <a href="https://github.blog/engineering/architecture-optimization/the-technology-behind-githubs-new-code-search/">here</a>.
  My day-to-day work focuses on operating large-scale networked services, creating new API's, employing code generation, profiling CPU / memory to optimize various use cases,
  and uses a variety of technologies and concurrency models. Fundamental to providing effective code search is the parsing of various programming languages, and I have worked extensively in the open-source <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">Tree-sitter</a>
  parser generator ecosystem.
</p>
  
<p>
  I love programming languages and programming language theory, and program in several languages including Rust, Golang, Ruby, Python, Haskell, Erlang / Elixir, SQL, and JavaScript / TypeScript.
  My preference is for languages with rich type systems. I have a deep appreciation for the lambda calculus, combinator theory, type theory, and functional programming.

  I'm currently a graduate student working towards completion of an MSc in the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-software-engineering">Software Engineering Programme</a> at Oxford University. I expect to complete the program in May 2026.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of software engineering I enjoy woodworking, surfing, and cooking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_pizza">Napoletana-style pizza</a>.
  Thanks for stopping by!
