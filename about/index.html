    <p>👋 I'm Rick Winfrey.</p>

    <p>
      Understanding code, at scale, across languages, and across teams, is one of the hardest problems in software. It's a challenge for humans and AI alike, and I've spent my career building tools that help bridge that gap.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most recently at Nuanced, I focused on bringing code intelligence to AI coding agents. I built <a href="https://github.com/nuanced-dev/lsp">Nuanced LSP</a>, an LSP server multiplexer with a container-based architecture, which I wrote about in <a href="https://www.nuanced.dev/blog/nuanced-lsp-scaling-precise-code-intelligence">Scaling Precise Code Intelligence for AI Agents</a>. I also built a TypeScript SDK and CLI to make it easy to integrate LSP into agent workflows, and Eval-Agent, a harness for analyzing multi-turn agent traces, measuring how code intelligence tooling affects task duration, cost, and token usage. You can read about the experiments I designed on Nuanced's blog, <a href="https://www.nuanced.dev/blog/evaluating-lsp">Evaluating the impact of LSP-based code intelligence on coding agents</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prior to Nuanced, I spent ten years at GitHub building code intelligence and search systems. On the parsing and analysis side, I contributed to the <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">Tree-sitter</a> ecosystem and helped build <a href="https://github.com/github/semantic">Semantic</a>, an experimental program analysis framework in Haskell. That work fed into <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/navigating-code-on-github">GitHub code navigation</a>: I helped build the distributed system powering jump-to-definition and find-all-references from the ground up, and later helped implement <a href="https://github.com/github/stack-graphs">Stack Graphs</a>, a novel approach to name binding resolution that powered <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/precise-code-navigation-python-code-navigation-pull-requests/#precise-code-navigation-for-python">precise code navigation</a>. I also contributed to the initial version of Copilot Chat and designed and implemented its prompt-building library, and was a core member of the code search team that built <a href="https://github.blog/engineering/architecture-optimization/the-technology-behind-githubs-new-code-search/">Blackbird</a>. I tried to capture what I learned in <a href="https://rickwinfrey.com/writings/10-lessons-from-github">10 Lessons from 10 Years at GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      My initial passion was human languages (Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, and Korean), which led to a love of programming languages. I've worked across systems languages (Go, Rust), dynamic languages (Ruby, Elixir/Erlang, Python), and pure functional languages (Haskell), and have a deep appreciation for the lambda calculus, type theory, and functional programming. I also enjoy the challenges of large-scale distributed systems, profile-guided optimization, and designing concurrent solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work, I'm nearing the completion of a MSc in the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-software-engineering">Software Engineering Programme</a> at Oxford University. My thesis explores source code deduplication through the lens of content-defined chunking, and I've written up the background research as a <a href="https://rickwinfrey.com/writings/content-defined-chunking-part-1">series of blog posts</a>. I expect to complete the program in May 2026. When I'm not studying, I enjoy the planning and precision of woodworking, the physical challenge of surfing, and attempting to make a perfect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_pizza">Neapolitan pizza</a>. Thanks for visiting.
