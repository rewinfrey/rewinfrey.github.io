<p>
I've been intrigued by the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator#Y_combinator">Y-Combinator</a>
since I was first introduced to the idea by a friend. On face value, the idea of recursion via
nothing but lambda expressions is a subtle and powerful concept that takes time to sink in and
reveal its inner elegance and simplicity. It truly feels like a wonder of wonders.
</p>

<p>
Yet, today I attempted to convey that wonder of wonders to my coworkers. As part of my 30 days of Haskell challenge,
I prepared a short presentation about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">the λ (lambda) calculus</a>.
The goal was two-fold, provide enough basic context about the λ calculus to feel comfortable with <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Beta_reduction">Beta Reduction</a>,
so that it would be possible to Beta Reduce the Y-Combinator to show how it allows for recursion through
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_%28computer_science%29">Divergence</a>.
</p>

<p>
But most of all, I wanted to provide others that have the same curiosity I have about the Y-Combinator, with a pure λ calculus visual
Beta Reduction that reveals how the divergence occurs. My goal was to allow others the ability to experience the wonder of the
Y-Combinator for themselves, and to experience that "Aha!" moment when it finally clicks, by hopefully providing them with enough
visual context to put the pieces together for themselves.
</p>

<p>
The slides of the presentation are available <a href="/downloads/lambda_calculus.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. If you have any feedback, or critiques, please
feel free to contact me at rick dot winfrey at gmail dot com.

<p>
If you are wanting to learn more about the λ calculus,
I highly recommend you read <a href="http://bitemyapp.com/">Chris Allen's</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/argumatronic?lang=en">Julie Moronuki's</a>
treatment of the λ calculus in <a href="http://haskellbook.com/">Haskell Programming <em>from first principles</em></a>,
and then continue on with Raul Rojas' <a href="http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS03/alpi/lambda.pdf">A Tutorial Introduction to the Lambda Calculus</a>.
</p>

<p>
Happy λ!
