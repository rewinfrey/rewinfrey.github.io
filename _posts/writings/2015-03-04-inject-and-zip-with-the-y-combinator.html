summary: An exploration of how Ruby's <code>inject</code> and <code>zip</code> methods can be implemented using nothing but anonymous functions and the Y-combinator. A silly, elegant, mind-bending combinator journey that is slower than you'd like.

<p>
Lately I've wondered what it would be like to try to write some of Ruby's enumerable methods
using only lambdas. I previously had given a talk about the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator#What_is_a_.22combinator.22.3F" target="_blank">
Y-combinator</a> and was already familiar with the notion of a fixed point combinator. I was
curious to see what it would take to implement Ruby's
<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-inject" target="_blank">inject</a>
method supporting the basic arithmetic operations and Ruby's
<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-zip" target="_blank">zip</a> method.
</p>

<p>
To follow this post, I'm assuming you have a comfortable familiarity with the Y-combinator.
If you're new to the Y-combinator, I would suggest first viewing an inspiring and thorough
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FITJMJjASUs" target="_blank">talk</a>
given by the late Jim Weirich. The overview he provides of how the Y-combinator works, along with
the explanations about the underlying concepts from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus" target="_blank">lambda calculus</a>
used by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry" target="_blank">Haskell Curry</a>
to formally define the Y-combinator will give you a solid foundation for understanding the concept.
However, in a nutshell, the Y-combinator allows us the ability to employ recursion
using only anonymous functions.
</p>

<p>
Let's take a look at a classic example of a Y-combinator application - calculating a factorial.
You'll notice that the result is stored as a local variable, but otherwise the recursion is
handled entirely via anonymous functions via Ruby's lambda short-hand operator, the -> operator.
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}

# Find the factorial of 5
5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

# Y-combinator solution
result = -> (builder, number) { builder.call(builder, number) }.call(
  -> (recurse, number) {
    return 1 if number == 0
    return number * recurse.call(recurse, number - 1)
  },
  5
)

result # => 120
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Given that we have this example of a factorial Y-combinator, let's take a look at what
inject looks like given the constraint of only using anonymous functions.
</p>


{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# Ruby inject example
[*0..10].inject(&:+) # => 55

# Y-combinator solution
result = -> (builder, limit, count = 0) { builder.call(builder, limit, count) }.call(
  -> (recurse, limit, count) {
    return 0 if count > limit
    return count + recurse.call(recurse, limit, count + 1)
  },
  10
)

result # => 55
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
This Y-combinator gives us the correct result, but there are limitations with this  solution.
The first is that we are required to pass in a limit as an input parameter rather than
a collection or a range with arbitrary start and stop points. This solution
is also only capable of addition. Should we choose to implement inject-like functionality
using multiplication instead, we would have to duplicate most of this solution.
Let's make our Y-combinator solution a little more sophisticated, so that it can handle a
range or collection as an input parameter, and also support any of the basic arithmetic operations.
</p>


{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# Ruby inject example
[100, 10].inject(&:*) # => 1000

# Y-combinator solution
result = -> (builder, range, operator) { builder.call(builder, range, operator) }.call(
  -> (recurse, range, operator, count = 0) {
    if range[count] == range[-1]
      return range[count].send(operator, operator == :* || operator == :/ ? 1 : 0)
    else
      return range[count].send(operator, recurse.call(recurse, range, operator, count + 1))
    end
  },
  [100, 10],
  :*
)

result # => 1000
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The approach now takes in a range or collection and an operator as input parameters.
In order to support a generic Y-combinator that allows for any arithmetic operation, we make
use of the various arithmetic identities. Given Ruby's Smalltalk roots, we can send
the operator message to each of the elements in the provided range or collection. To prove
this works, I've included examples of subtraction and division below.
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# Ruby inject example with subtraction
[100, 10].inject(&:-) # => 90

# Y-combinator solution
result = -> (builder, range, operator) { builder.call(builder, range, operator) }.call(
  -> (recurse, range, operator, count = 0) {
    if range[count] == range[-1]
      return range[count].send(operator, operator == :* || operator == :/ ? 1 : 0)
    else
      return range[count].send(operator, recurse.call(recurse, range, operator, count + 1))
    end
  },
  [100, 10],
  :-
)

result # => 90

# Ruby inject example with division
[100, 10].inject(&:/) # => 10

# Y-combinator solution
result = -> (builder, range, operator) { builder.call(builder, range, operator) }.call(
  -> (recurse, range, operator, count = 0) {
    if range[count] == range[-1]
      return range[count].send(operator, operator == :* || operator == :/ ? 1 : 0)
    else
      return range[count].send(operator, recurse.call(recurse, range, operator, count + 1))
    end
  },
  [100, 10],
  :/
)

result # => 10
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Now let's take a look at Ruby's zip method. This one is a little more interesting because
it involves two collections.
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# Ruby zip example
[*0..5].zip([*100..105]) # => [[0, 100], [1, 101], [2, 102], [3, 103], [4, 104], [5, 105]]

result = -> (builder, collection1, collection2, count = 0) { builder.call(builder, collection1, collection2, count) }.call(
  -> (recurse, collection1, collection2, count) {
    return [] if count == collection1.count
    return recurse.call(recurse, collection1, collection2, count + 1).push([collection1[collection1.count - 1 - count], collection2[collection2.count - 1 - count]])
  },
  [*0..5],
  [*100..105]
)

result # => [[0, 100], [1, 101], [2, 102], [3, 103], [4, 104], [5, 105]]
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
I ran into a problem initially with implementing zip as a Y-combinator. Ruby does not have a
cons function similar to cons found in Lisp or Scheme. I reasoned I could create an accumulator
variable and pass it along through each recursive call, but the mutation of that accumulator
variable is troubling. I reasoned that the base case of the recursive function would instead
return an empty array, to which the zipped tuples of both collections would be added.
</p>

<p>
Just for fun I was curious to see how the Y-combinator zip solution profiled against Ruby's
zip method. The results are unsurprising. Ruby's native zip method is far better optimized
than recursive lambda calls.
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
require 'benchmark'

native_result = Benchmark.measure do
  10000.times do
    [*0..100].zip([*0..100])
  end
end

native_result.real # => 0.177837

y_combinator_result = Benchmark.measure do
  10000.times do
    -> (builder, collection1, collection2, count = 0) { builder.call(builder, collection1, collection2, count) }.call(
      -> (recurse, collection1, collection2, count) {
        return [] if count == collection1.count
        return recurse.call(recurse, collection1, collection2, count + 1).push([collection1[collection1.count - 1 - count], collection2[collection2.count - 1 - count]])
      },
      [*0..100],
      [*0..100]
    )
  end
end

y_combinator_result.real # => 0.61685

(native_result.real - y_combinator_result.real) / native_result.real.to_f * 100 # => -246%

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Although the Y-combinator zip method is roughly 246% less performant than Ruby's native zip method,
the exercise of implementing two of Ruby's enumerable methods using Y-combinators was good fun.
