I"Š <p>In working on the Rails wrapper for my tic tac toe application, I talked in <a href="http://selfless-singleton.rickwinfrey.com/2012/12/11/debug-params/">yesterdayâ€™s post</a> about the problem of HTTP being stateless. This is a problem when we make objects that contain some kind of state data (in this context itâ€™s the game board). So to get around that, I decided to write the game data to the database and then pull it out for each request, reinitialize a series of objects needed to facilitate the next move of the game, and repeat until the game is finished.</p>

<p>Last night I was curious if there was another way to think about this problem, so I asked my roommate <a href="http://www.joshcheek.com/">Josh Cheek</a> what he thought about my solution. He said it makes sense, but why not use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">serialization</a>? I knew that serialization was a thing, but didnâ€™t know how to use it or what its benefits were. So we walked through a simple example, and I was very happy to learn that by serializing objects to a database in Rails, I can pull that object back out of the database and it will be a clone of that object! The process of taking a serialized object and reconstituting back as an object is called deserialization. That made me very happy to learn, because now I can streamline my Rails code to simply pull out a game object that has previously been serialized.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s take a look at how to serialize an object in Rails (using the Railsâ€™ serialize approach rather than <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Marshal.html">Marshalling</a>):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Game &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  serialize :board
end

class Board
  def initialize(board = Array.new(9) { |i| i })
    @board = board
  end
end

board = Board.new
game = Game.create! turn: 1, board: board
Game.first.board # =&gt; #&lt;Board:0x007fca442908b8 @board=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]&gt;
board            # =&gt; #&lt;Board:0x007fca441185f8 @board=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]&gt;

board.to_YAML    # =&gt; "--- !ruby/object:Board\nboard:\n- 0\n- 1\n- 2\n- 3\n- 4\n- 5\n- 6\n- 7\n- 8\n"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, my model is Game, and Iâ€™m interested in serializing the game board, so I include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">serialize :board</code> in the Game model. Then, in my Board class, I can create a new board instance. When I create a new Game instance with a board, the board object is serialized to the database as YAML. When I retrieve this record out of the database, the board is deserialized as a board object with the same object id! This is done through some ActiveRecord magic, but Iâ€™m guessing it is probably using YAML::load(data) when it pull out a record that is serialized.</p>

<p>To understand more about how YAML serialization works, hereâ€™s an example of how to implement your own serialization of an object using YAML and then deserialize it.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>require 'YAML'

class RetainAttributeOfToYAML
  attr_accessor :name
  def initialize(name)
    @name = "Hi, my name is #{name}."
  end
end

class ToYAML
  attr_accessor :attribute_to_retain
  def initialize(attribute)
    @attribute_to_retain = attribute
  end
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Given this structure, we can create a new RetainAttributeOfToYAML object, and instantiate a ToYAML object with our RetainAttributeOfToYAML object. This will allow us to show that when serializing, any objects that are part of the object we are serializing are also serialized. Hereâ€™s the process:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>attribute1 = RetainAttributeOfToYAML.new("Schrodinger")
attribute2 = RetainAttributeOfToYAML.new("Cat")

ex1 = ToYAML.new(attribute1)
ex2 = ToYAML.new(attribute2)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we have ex1 and ex2, which look like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ex1.inspect                         # =&gt; "#&lt;ToYAML:0x007f9832826208 @attribute_to_retain=#&lt;RetainAttributeOfToYAML:0x007f9832826bb8
                                    @name=\"Hi, my name is Schrodinger.\"&gt;&gt;"

ex2.inspect                         # =&gt; "#&lt;ToYAML:0x007f9832826140 @attribute_to_retain=#&lt;RetainAttributeOfToYAML:0x007f9832826320
                                    @name=\"Hi, my name is Cat.\"&gt;&gt;"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Letâ€™s first serialize the data. Weâ€™ll use YAML::dump to do this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ex1_serialized   = YAML::dump(ex1)

ex2_serialized   = YAML::dump(ex2)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This produces a YAML serialized version of ex1 and ex2 that is human readable:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ex1_serialized.inspect              # =&gt; "\"--- !ruby/object:ToYAML\\nattribute_to_retain: !ruby/object:RetainAttributeOfToYAML\\n
                                    name: Hi, my name is Schrodinger.\\n\""

ex2_serialized.inspect              # =&gt; "\"--- !ruby/object:ToYAML\\nattribute_to_retain: !ruby/object:RetainAttributeOfToYAML\\n
                                    name: Hi, my name is Cat.\\n\""
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point we could write this to a database or to a file. Letâ€™s say we did, and that at some point in the future, we want to get the serialized ex1 and ex2 objects back into their object form so we access their attributes. We can use YAML::load like so:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ex1_deserialized = YAML::load(ex1_serialized)

ex2_deserialized = YAML::load(ex2_serialized)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This gives us back an object again, that is nearly identical to our original ex1 and ex2 objects:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ex1_deserialized.inspect            # =&gt; "#&lt;ToYAML:0x007f9832822108 @attribute_to_retain=#&lt;RetainAttributeOfToYAML:0x007f9832821f28
                                    @name=\"Hi, my name is Schrodinger.\"&gt;&gt;"

ex2_deserialized.inspect            # =&gt; "#&lt;ToYAML:0x007f9832821578 @attribute_to_retain=#&lt;RetainAttributeOfToYAML:0x007f98328213e8
                                    @name=\"Hi, my name is Cat.\"&gt;&gt;"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The only difference between our original objects and our deserialized objects is the object id. This is because weâ€™ve actually created new objects:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ex1.object_id                             # =&gt; 70145695875260
ex1_deserialized.object_id                # =&gt; 70145695863100

ex2.object_id                             # =&gt; 70361052403020
ex2_deserialized.object_id                # =&gt; 70361052391960
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Yet they still function in the same way and encapsulate the same data:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ex1.attribute_to_retain.name              # =&gt; "Hi, my name is Schrodinger."
ex1_deserialized.attribute_to_retain.name # =&gt; "Hi, my name is Schrodinger."

ex2.attribute_to_retain.name              # =&gt; "Hi, my name is Cat."
ex2_deserialized.attribute_to_retain.name # =&gt; "Hi, my name is Cat."
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And thatâ€™s it for serializing things with YAML. I found this <a href="http://www.skorks.com/2010/04/serializing-and-deserializing-objects-with-ruby/">post</a> very helpful in understanding how YAML works, and it also has a great explanation of how to do a similar thing with JSON and Marshal.</p>

<p>After getting more of my user stories done, Iâ€™m going to play around with the idea of <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2011/11/19/how-to-marshal-procs-using-rubinius/">serializing closures</a>.</p>
