<p>Going to the Libertyville office is a 70 minute train ride one way. It takes me about 20 minutes to walk to the train station from my apartment, so round trip total time is 3 hours. This might seem like a substantial amount of time to devote to commuting, but aside for the time spent walking, I get to enjoy train coding.</p>

<p>Most of the time I try to write my blog on the train ride home. It gives me a cap on how long to spend on a post, so I donâ€™t over do it. In the mornings the train ride in gives me a chance to warm up my brain. Iâ€™ve started working on the bowling game kata, and Iâ€™ll use the train ride in as a way to practice that.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m doing the bowling game kata in Java, so today I found myself getting a lot more comfortable with the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ Idea IDE</a>. I wish my Java instructor had told us about this IDE when I took Java in college - it puts Eclipse or NetBeans to shame. The only part of using Idea Iâ€™m not crazy about is the key bindings are so different than what Iâ€™m used to in Vim and a little different than TextMate. <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/craig-demyanovich">Craig Demyanovich</a> told me Idea offers a Vim key-bindings plugin. Iâ€™ve downloaded it, but am having some trouble getting it to install correctly. Iâ€™ll play with it over the weekend.</p>

<p>Today there wasnâ€™t one thing that stood out to me as being a great new insight or answer to a problem. Today was a day I got to get a lot of code time in, refactored many of the mistakes I talked about in <a href="http://selfless-singleton.rickwinfrey.com/2013/01/16/owning-mistakes/">yesterdayâ€™s post</a>, and created some new abstractions to better define the responsibility of some objects. A strange test condition gave me the idea to instantiate a class from inside its own instance, and I played around with that idea a little in Ruby to see how it would work. The first time I did it, I inadvertently setup an infinite loop - and saw â€œstack level too deepâ€. That reminded me of how I wish the â€œstack level too deepâ€ error message was a little more nuanced, because itâ€™s not clear if itâ€™s a stack overflow due to an infinite loop (like a class instantiating itself over and over again), or if itâ€™s because the process actually requires too much memory to complete the task.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is Friday! And that means <a href="http://university.8thlight.com/">8th Light University</a> and Waza. Iâ€™m really looking forward to hearing Micahâ€™s talk about the â€œAbsolute Priority Premise,â€ and in general getting to work towards finishing the tic tac toe library.</p>
