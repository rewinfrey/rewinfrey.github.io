I"Ò#<p>It‚Äôs certainly been a SOLID week. On a personal note, I was successful in refactoring my Ruby tic tac toe program to not violate any of the SOLID principles. I also added in the ability for the player to choose between an easy, medium or hard AI to play against. Currently I‚Äôm extending my base classes to make possible playing 4x4 tic tac toe, to be followed by a 3D implementation. Because I‚Äôve managed to preserve SOLID principles, particularly the Liskov Substitution Principle, the Interface Segregation Principle and the Open / Closed Principle, I‚Äôm easily able to extend my application to account for these new game types. Mostly I‚Äôm able to achieve this by utilizing the three benefits of OOP we‚Äôve talked about this week (encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism), and creating abstract interfaces for how various objects of my application talk with each other. It is rewarding to learn about these ideas and have the opportunity to implement them in a way that verifies their purported benefits.</p>

<p>To cap off the week, we will look at the final SOLID principle, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/8thlight.com/file/d/0BwhCYaYDn8EgMjdlMWIzNGUtZTQ0NC00ZjQ5LTkwYzQtZjRhMDRlNTQ3ZGMz/edit?hl=en">Dependency Inversion Principle</a>. This is perhaps one of the most powerful ideas of the bunch, because in order to preserve this principle it relies on successfully implementing the other four principles. As I‚Äôve grappled with these ideas this week, I‚Äôve seen that the underlying connections between these principles creates a self-supporting architecture of concepts, and is a beautiful structure in itself.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs first look at the formal definition of the Dependency Inversion Principle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>b. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like to think of levels of abstraction as a hierarchy. At the top is the highest level of abstraction, and it most generally defines behavior for any class or module that may inherit from it. At each successive level of abstraction, the implementation details grow gradually more concrete, until we arrive at the bottom levels of abstraction which strictly concern themselves with the concrete details of implementation.</p>

<p>To see this in action, let‚Äôs revisit our very simple banking application we‚Äôve developed throughout the week. First, let‚Äôs look at our interface for calculating monthly interest rates:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class AccountCalcMonthlyInterestInterface
  attr_accessor :account, :calc_monthly_interest
  def initialize(options)
    self.account               = options[:account]
    self.calc_monthly_interest = CalcMonthlyInterest.new
  end

  def apply_interest
  end
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This represents our highest level of abstraction so far for calculating monthly interest rates for various types of accounts. In the most general way possible we define behavior, not through actual implementation, but by idea. We leave the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apply_interest</code> method defined in name only, but without any further clues as to how to define that particular behavior. This is done so that as we inherit from this abstract interface, we know what we need to implement in a lower-level abstraction, such as the CheckingInterestInterface we created <a href="http://selfless-singleton.rickwinfrey.com/2012/12/06/building-solid-foundations-of-oop-part-4-isp/">yesterday</a>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class CheckingInterestInterface &lt; AccountCalcMonthlyInterestInterface
  def apply_interest
    calc_monthly_interest.for_checking(account)
  end
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this context, we are one level of abstraction lower than the interface we inherit from, so we would expect this level to provide a greater level of concrete detail in implementation when compared with its parent (AccountCalcMonthlyInterestInterface). That‚Äôs precisely what we do.</p>

<p>There exists a problem with this implementation, however, and it squarely violates the Dependency Inversion Principle. Did you spot it yet? Let‚Äôs look again at our highest level of abstraction:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class AccountCalcMonthlyInterestInterface
  attr_accessor :account, :calc_monthly_interest
  def initialize(options)
    self.account               = options[:account]
    self.calc_monthly_interest = CalcMonthlyInterest.new
  end

  def apply_interest
  end
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we recall what DIP says, then we remember that ‚ÄúHigh-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.‚Äù Yet, our intialize method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self.calc_monthly_interest = CalcMonthlyInterest.new</code> is a prime example of a high-level module (our interface) depending on a low-level module (CalcMonthlyInterest). While this might not at this time be a problem, it will be if we remember OCP - our segment of code should be <em>open</em> for extension but <em>closed</em> for modification. In this instance, if we wish at some point in the future to give bank customers a choice of monthly interest rate schemes, which also requires us to be able to calculate interest rates differently depending on the customer, and not just on the account type, we will have to violate OCP in order to implement that new requirement. We will also violate the Interface Segregation Principle in order to determine what kind of interest rate scheme a particular account needs, and provide some form of conditional checking to determine how to process that interest calculation.</p>

<p>All of sudden, this small violation of the Dependency Inversion Principle could potentially spawn two other SOLID principle violations. A few more violation chains like this, and our code starts to rot. This won‚Äôt be immediatley apparent, but over time, the code rot will continue to spread throughout the application. One compromise here leads to another compromise there. It‚Äôs a sad but very stark reality that a company‚Äôs most important piece of software can succumb to this fate. When the code rot reaches a certain level, it becomes nearly impossible to work with the code base, bugs go unfixed, users stop paying and the company suffers a prolonged disintegration.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs interesting that the Dependency Inversion Principle contains the word inversion. Here, our abstract interface depends on CalcMonthlyInterest, but what if we <em>inverted</em> that dependency? What would that look like? Well, in Ruby, it‚Äôs extremely simple, we can simply pass in an object to our abstract class that we wish to use as a subtype for the general behavior we want the more concrete classes to implement, like so:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class AccountCalcMonthlyInterestInterface
  attr_accessor :account, :calc_monthly_interest
  def initialize(options)
    self.account               = options[:account]
    self.calc_monthly_interest = options[:interest_scheme].new
  end

  def apply_interest
  end
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It‚Äôs a bit subtle, but very powerful. Now our AccountCalcMonthlyInterestInterface doesn‚Äôt care what <em>kind</em> of interest rate scheme we use, all it is concerned with is that there is one provided to it when the interface is used. Now we can easily use this interface with any number of interest rate schemes and various account types. This code is simple and flexible, it does not violate any of the SOLID principles, and it utilizes the three benefits of OOP.</p>

<p>That wraps up this week‚Äôs tour of SOLID. For any present and future readers, I hope that this introduction, as simple as it is, gives you greater clarity in understanding and greater ability in applying these ideas. When we step back and consider the moral and ethical weights our role in society as a programmer entails, it‚Äôs important to remember that our code does not simply touch and reach out to every human or machine that interacts with that code, but it also influences in a very real way the livelihoods and occupations of those arround us. Whew, that was heavy, but it‚Äôs not a weight we have to burden our shoulders with (<a href="http://health.yahoo.net/experts/menshealth/most-dangerous-thing-youll-do-all-day">sitting for many hours a day will do that for you</a>) when we remember a few principles and guidelines for how to write good, clean code. So smile, relax and think of your favorite cat:</p>
